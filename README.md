# Geospatial Project Collection by Kaushik Ravi

Welcome to my repository of geospatial projects! Here, you'll find a collection of geopackages from various projects I’ve worked on, ranging from environmental analysis to urban planning and historical mapping. These projects aim to provide insightful visualizations and analyses using geospatial data.

Feel free to explore, use, and contribute to any of these datasets. Below is a brief overview of each project and the associated files.

## Projects Overview

1. **World’s Top 10 Earthquakes (2000-2020)**
   - A study of the largest earthquakes globally over two decades, visualizing their locations and magnitudes.

2. **Digitization of Old Bangalore Map (1924) - Case Study on Lakes**
   - A historical map of Bangalore digitized to analyze the city’s lake systems, comparing past and present data.

3. **Karnataka Road Network Analysis - District-wise Total Road Length**
   - A breakdown of Karnataka's road infrastructure, analyzing total road lengths across districts.

4. **Maritime Piracy (2000-2017)**
   - A visualization of anti-shipping activities and piracy incidents across the world’s oceans during this period.

5. **Morning Bicycle Ride Visualization**
   - A geospatial representation of one of my daily morning bicycle routes—mapping the path, distance, and elevation.

6. **New York City Population Density (2010)**
   - A snapshot of population distribution in New York City from the 2010 census, showcasing density variations across boroughs.

7. **Bangalore’s Population Density around Metro Stations**
   - A detailed analysis of population density within a 1km radius of metro stations in Bangalore.

8. **Land Use Data for Major Parts of Berlin**
   - A land-use analysis of Berlin, categorized into Commercial, Industrial, and Residential zones.

9. **3D Visualization of Denali Digital Elevation Model**
   - A 3D terrain visualization of Denali, showcasing its elevation features through a digital elevation model (DEM).

## How to Use

- Each project folder contains the relevant geopackage files.
- To view and manipulate the data, you can use GIS software such as QGIS or ArcGIS.
- For coding or custom analysis, these geopackages can be integrated into Python or R workflows using libraries like `geopandas` or `rgdal`.
